## Project Sightscope
This project was initially developed as a hackathon project and utilizes deep learning model specifically the VGG16 architecture, which is a popular CNN architecture for image recognition tasks. It's an implementation of an image captioning model that combines computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to automatically generate text captions that describe the visual content of the images.
